      <h2>Display Ads</h2>
      <h3>What Are They?</h3>
      <p>Display ads are visual advertisements that appear in various formats such as banners, boxes, or videos on your website. They are typically served by networks like Google AdSense.</p>
      <h3>How Do They Work?</h3>
      <p>After signing up with an ad network, you integrate their code into your site. The network then fills your designated ad slots with content from various advertisers. Revenue is generated based on the number of impressions or clicks.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Easy to implement and can generate passive income as your traffic grows.</li>

      </ul>
      <h3>Best Practices</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Place ads in non-intrusive areas where they complement your content.</li>
        <li>Utilize responsive ad units to ensure a good fit on all devices.</li>
        <li>Test different sizes and positions to optimize revenue without sacrificing aesthetics.</li>
      </ul>
