      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Monetizing your website is all about turning your traffic into cash. Whether you’ve got a blog, a portfolio, or just a cool idea, there are tons of ways to make money online. In this tutorial, I’ll break down the most popular methods and show you how they work—by actually using them on this page. As you scroll, you’ll see real ads, affiliate links, and more, each with an arrow pointing to it so you can see it in action. Pretty meta, huh? Let’s kick things off with one of the classics: display ads.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="display-ads" class="monetization-section lazy-section" data-content="display-ads">
      <h2>Display Ads</h2>
      <h3>What Are They?</h3>
      <p>Display ads are those banners, boxes, or videos you see on websites. Ad networks like Google AdSense pay you every time someone views or clicks them. It’s a simple way to earn passive income, and you’ve probably seen them all over the internet.</p>
      <h3>How Do They Work?</h3>
      <p>You sign up with an ad network, paste their code into your site, and voilà—ads start showing up. You get paid based on impressions (how many people see the ad) or clicks (how many people interact with it).</p>
      <h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pros</strong>: Easy to set up, scales with traffic.</li>
        <li><strong>Cons</strong>: Can annoy users if overdone, lower earnings without huge traffic.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Best Practices</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Place ads where they’re visible but not intrusive (like the side of the page).</li>
        <li>Avoid covering content—users hate that.</li>
        <li>Test different sizes and positions to see what works.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Live Example</h3>
      <div class="placeholder">[Ad Placeholder: Imagine a real banner ad here!]</div>
      <span class="section-arrow">← Here’s what a side‑of‑the‑page ad looks like!</span>
      <p>This is where a real ad would sit—maybe a 300x250 pixel banner. If this were live, I’d earn a few cents every time you saw it or clicked it.</p>
      <h3>Try It Out</h3>

    <section id="affiliate-marketing" class="monetization-section lazy-section" data-content="affiliate-marketing">
      <h2>Affiliate Marketing</h2>
      <h3>What Is It?</h3>
      <p>Affiliate marketing is when you promote someone else’s product and earn a commission for every sale made through your link. Think of it like being a digital salesperson.</p>
      <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
      <p>You join an affiliate program (like Amazon Associates), grab a unique link, and share it on your site. When someone buys through your link, you get a cut—usually 5-20% of the sale.</p>
      <h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pros</strong>: High earning potential, no inventory needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Cons</strong>: Takes time to build trust, depends on conversions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Best Practices</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Pick products that match your audience.</li>
        <li>Be honest—disclose that it’s an affiliate link.</li>
        <li>Use compelling calls‑to‑action (CTAs).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Live Example</h3>
      <a href="https://example.com/affiliate-product" class="affiliate-link">Buy this awesome web hosting plan!</a>
      <span class="section-arrow">← This is an affiliate link!</span>
      <p>If you clicked that and bought hosting, I’d earn a commission—maybe $5 or more.</p>

    <section id="sponsored-content" class="monetization-section lazy-section" data-content="sponsored-content">
      <h2>Sponsored Content</h2>
      <h3>What Is It?</h3>
      <p>Sponsored content is when a brand pays you to write about them or feature their stuff on your site. It’s like an ad, but more integrated into your content.</p>
      <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
      <p>A company contacts you (or you pitch them), you agree on a fee, and you create a post or section showcasing their product. Disclosure is key—it’s legally required!</p>
      <h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pros</strong>: Big payouts, builds partnerships.</li>
        <li><strong>Cons</strong>: Requires an audience, can feel salesy.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Best Practices</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep it authentic—only promote what you’d use.</li>
        <li>Label it clearly: “Sponsored by [Brand].”</li>
        <li>Negotiate fair rates based on your reach.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Live Example</h3>
      <div class="placeholder">[Sponsored by CoolBrand™: This section is brought to you by our pals at CoolBrand!]</div>
      <span class="section-arrow">← This is sponsored content!</span>
      <p>A real sponsor might pay $50 or more for this spot.</p>

    <section id="selling-digital-products" class="monetization-section lazy-section" data-content="digital-products">
      <h2>Selling Digital Products</h2>
      <h3>What Is It?</h3>
      <p>You create and sell your own stuff—like ebooks, courses, or templates—directly to your audience. It’s all profit, minus platform fees.</p>
      <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
      <p>Make a product, host it on a platform like Gumroad or Teachable, and link to it from your site. People buy, you deliver digitally.</p>
      <h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pros</strong>: High margins, full control.</li>
        <li><strong>Cons</strong>: Takes time to create, needs marketing.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Best Practices</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Solve a problem your audience has.</li>
        <li>Price it right—test $5, $10, or $20.</li>
        <li>Offer a sample to hook buyers.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Live Example</h3>
      <a href="https://example.com/ebook" class="digital-product-link">Get my Monetization Ebook for $9.99!</a>
      <span class="section-arrow">← This is a digital product link!</span>
      <p>If you bought that, I’d pocket $9.99 (minus a small fee).</p>

    <section id="memberships-subscriptions" class="monetization-section lazy-section" data-content="memberships">
      <h2>Memberships &amp; Subscriptions</h2>
      <h3>What Is It?</h3>
      <p>You charge visitors for access to premium content—like exclusive articles, videos, or a community. Think Patreon or Substack.</p>
      <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
      <p>Set up a paywall using a tool like Memberful, then offer teasers to entice sign‑ups. Charge monthly or yearly.</p>
      <h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pros</strong>: Recurring revenue, loyal fans.</li>
        <li><strong>Cons</strong>: Need consistent value, harder to start.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Best Practices</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Give freebies to build trust.</li>
        <li>Keep premium content fresh.</li>
        <li>Start small—$5/month is a sweet spot.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Live Example</h3>
      <div class="placeholder">[Premium Content: Subscribe for $10/month to unlock!]</div>
      <span class="section-arrow">← This is a membership paywall!</span>

    <section id="donations" class="monetization-section lazy-section" data-content="donations">
      <h2>Donations</h2>
      <h3>What Is It?</h3>
      <p>You ask your audience to support you directly, usually through platforms like Buy Me a Coffee or PayPal.</p>
      <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
      <p>Add a donation button or link, and encourage contributions with a heartfelt message. It’s all voluntary!</p>
      <h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pros</strong>: Simple, no middleman.</li>
        <li><strong>Cons</strong>: Unpredictable, relies on generosity.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Best Practices</h3>

        <li>Offer perks (e.g., a shoutout).</li>
